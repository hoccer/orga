* Large merge tickets

##### 16 SEP

* We were extremely under pressure by the hard deadline 05 SEP
* We worked overtime, Berlin was involved, Lots of coordination
* We started doing code reviews
* Some large tickets would have been tracked in the next iteration: to reduce variance the next iteration was included in this one
* Tickets which involved camera, images, memory etc were extremely hard to tackle: all exceeded estimated time
* It turns out that 2 week review evaluation are prone to variance, 3 weeks would be better

##### 07 OKT
