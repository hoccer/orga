### Review of Reviews Insights

##### 24 JUN

* Large merge tickets

##### 16 SEP

* We were extremely under pressure by the hard deadline 05 SEP
* We worked overtime, Berlin was involved, Lots of coordination
* We started doing code reviews
* Some large tickets would have been tracked in the next iteration: to reduce variance the next iteration was included in this one
* Tickets which involved camera, images, memory etc were extremely hard to tackle: all exceeded estimated time
* It turns out that 2 week review evaluation are prone to variance, 3 weeks would be better

##### 07 OKT

* We completely underestimated android ui features

##### 18 NOV

* One very very large ticket was due this iteration, it comprised the last 2-3 iterations ans was very big
* I decided to leave this ticket out of the stats, because it would influence the stats in a bad way
* Stats of the ticket (469): up-front estimation: 5, work days tracked: 24

##### 13 JAN

* When tickets grow too large we decided to subdivide them or do intermediate retros
* UI Integration was under-estimated again
* We had a very large bugticket (12 days tracked, partially from last iteration), a couple of other related bugs were also fixed within this ticket

##### 03 FEB

* When tickets grow too large we decided to subdivide them or do intermediate reviews
* For some reason this was a bad iteration
* Less time was tracked on tickets (Mirko is more and more involved in coordination)
* Few ticket were closed, some tracked time might have been stuck in the review column and will be tracked in the next review

##### 17 MAR

* A very challenging ticket was related to keeping nearby active, even when hoccer has lost focus, lots of pairing involved, the paring time was not calculated in the estimation
* A UI ticket was underestimated again

##### 07 APR

* An android lifecycle ticket was underestimated again 

##### 28 APR

* One use case (keep contacts when deleted) was immensely underestimated
* For new use cases more initial thought should be put into planning the feature

#### Stat Info

* Tracked pairing time: e.g. 5,5 days tracked pairing means 11 man days 
* For estimations: Considering the tickets that have an estimation after being worked on (we don't do initial estimations on tasks)
* For ALL estimations: x / y = z; x is days actually worked on that ticket after initial estimation, y is the first estimation during standup after initially working on that ticket, z is ratio (should be close to 1) 
* Tracked pairing time: e.g. 5,5 days tracked pairing means 11 man days
